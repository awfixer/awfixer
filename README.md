## Hey There, thanks for looking at my README

Personally I have made a choice and I do not host any repos on my profiles anymore, they are all in either my personal organization, or they are hosted in one of the Axyl Projects Organizations. If you want to learn more about me, I appreciate that, there are some links below that you can use to learn more about me, and do not be afraid to reach out, I will do my best to help. I have taken a pretty major step towards personal improvement recently, and I am happy for everyone who is, has, and will be on this journey with me.

## As of Recently I have been revealing a lot of "trade secrets" that I personally have used, in hopes that they benifit the FOSS Community as a whole, if you want to know more then join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/JRS5kcGwhk) and Look into them, the logs of what I am doing are located [here](https://discord.com/channels/901712639099543552/1271673023971197022) Hope it helps.

## Also Let it be known that I am now enforcing the FOSS CoC written my Derek Taylor, in all of my work, from Github, to Axyl Projects, and beyond, the only exception to that is [The Autism Community](https://theautismcommunity.net)

## Finally, I am officially supporting Autism, which can be taken however you want, I have Autism, and I want to make sure that everyone on the Spectrum gets a fair chance at life, you can support us through [GoFundMe](https://gofund.me/340dbad9)
