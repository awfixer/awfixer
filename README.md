## üî≠ Projects

## [AWFixerOS]

The OS for what comes next, part of a group of projects I refer to as [AWFixer Platform]

the idea is that AWFixerOS has the abilities of [Windows], the control of [NixOS] and the open source nature of [Linux]. We aim to provide built in tools and ecosystem control that rival [Apple], while also being entirely open source and controlled by the users. (i will expand on this later)


## [AWBorg]

This is a project that i have been thinking about for a while and have decided to try to impliment now for shits and giggles. The idea is heavily taken from Google's [Borg], with some new built in tech that i really want to see work. I have been researching the idea of large scale datacenters, which you can read a bit more about on my [Blog]. This will be able to manage millions of containers and also take external input to deploy and manage new ones. It will be a really cool project should it go according to plan.



## [Modded Android]

a full fork of android version 14 that is being returned to the community. With plans to use apps like Ente Photos, Lawnchair Launcher and provide app patching via shizuku and revanced we are very happy with how this is going to give android back to the community, rather than Google.
