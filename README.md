Hi, I'm AWFixer, also known as The Autist, or The Fixer, depending on the platform and/or place you see me. I'm a 21-year-old disabled hacker who had a stroke in 2024 and has been navigating life with a disability ever since. I love technology and crank out code like it's my job—because, well, it pretty much is. My go-to languages are Nix, Gleam, Elixir, Go, and Rust, though necessity sometimes drags me into JavaScript/TypeScript, Ruby, or Java.

Being disabled means I can pour massive amounts of time into writing code and contributing to open-source projects for next to nothing. I also handle community moderation gigs on the cheap. Sure, it comes with perks—like dirt-cheap rent and shorter waits in the ER—but I wouldn't recommend it to just anyone. Thanks to all that extra availability, feel free to treat this like a "[Book AWFixer]" service: hire me to manage one of your projects. After an initial fee, I keep rates low as long as I've got the bandwidth.

> [!NOTE]
> i am currently doing research into how GPT and BERT based LLMs work, because I want to understand it better. I feel like an advanced understanding of the GPT/BERT models will help me in my endevaour to create LLMs that run on general compute/conventional hardware rather than needing expensive GPU compute.


- 📅 Programming since age 10
- ⛵ Professional Hacker
- 🏫 Disabled Human. had a stroke in 2024.
- 🖥️ [NixOS] / [AWFixerOS] / [Modded Android]
- 🔧 if you are looking for my projects, keep scrolling, I promise they are great.

> [!NOTE]
> you may find that some of my projects are currently very sporadically maintained and developed, it is because a critical part of my family unit is having health issues, and i am dedicating a large portion of my time to making money for her and taking care of her. Thank you for understanding.

## 🔭 Projects

## [AWFixerOS]

The OS for what comes next

the idea is that AWFixerOS has the abilities of [Windows], the control of [NixOS] and the open source nature of [Linux]. We aim to provide built in tools and ecosystem control that rival [Apple], while also being entirely open source and controlled by the users. (i will expand on this later)

## SuperEngine (no link for this one, yet.)

The idea behind SuperEngine is sort of simple, yet very complicated at the same time. It serves to be a game engine for games in places like "The Oasis" in the Ready Player One movie. Which is needed for something that I am building.

## [AWBorg]

The TL;DR on this software? You don't need it. Hell, you didn't even need Kubernetes, and this beast will have you pining for K8s's halcyon days of relative simplicity.

I've been mulling this project for ages and finally decided to hack it together for shits and giggles. It's straight-up inspired by Google's [Borg], but with some fresh, built-in tech I'm dying to see in action. Lately, I've been geeking out on large-scale datacenters—dive deeper on [my blog] if you're curious. The goal? Seamlessly wrangle millions of containers, plus hooks for external inputs to spin up and tweak new ones on the fly. If it all clicks, it'll be an absolute riot.

I'm typically cagey about hyping my side quests like this, but the audacious scope here has me feeling oddly fearless. Expect a full teardown on [my blog] any day now.

## [Modded Android]

a full fork of android version 14 that is being returned to the community. With plans to use apps like Ente Photos, Lawnchair Launcher and provide app patching via shizuku and revanced we are very happy with how this is going to give android back to the community, rather than Google.

### 🫂 Communities I own/manage (will keep updating)

### 📖 currently learning:

im currently learning the languages 

- elixir
  - a language used for real time chat apps and apps needing high concurrance and fault talorance, runs on the BEAM and used at companies like WhatsApp and Discord.
- nix
  - a language that is widely used for declarity system and package management. I am learning this language as it will help me work on my AWFixerOS Project
- gleam
  - Gleam is a statically typed language that can compile to both BEAM VM bytecode and JavaScript for legacy interop
- Go (golang)
  - a language commonly used for APIs and related functions. Developed at google with a strong standard library and minimal need for external dependancies
- React Native/Java/Kotlin (Android Development)
  - I am learning this for the Modded Android Project that is detailed above

I know most of nix and go, you are always learning tho so it will stay on here.
