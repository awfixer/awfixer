I'm a, more commonly known as awfixer/fixer/austin/theautist on various parts of interwebs

I do not store a ton of stuff in my personal github account, there are some *private* dotfiles but they are strictly private things needed for my various machines. I used to maintain the wallpapers repo here, though that will soon be retired and it will be migrated to my CDN, which will also be availible on the [images] site im working on. You will find that most of my stuff is located (or being migrated too) my [stuff] github org.
